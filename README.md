## Lucas Polito - Cedar Design System take home

### Local versions of stuff

Just in case there's some weird stuff when running on your machine

- node - v20.16.0
- yarn - 1.22.22

### Running

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn build`
3. `yarn start`
4. Go to http://localhost:3000
5. To start the flow over, click the header logo

### Tests

Unfortunately I underestimated implementation time and I didn't get to the unit tests.
Would loved to have tested a11y, validation, keyboard navigability, etc. Definitely not ideal but I didn't want to go egregiously over time.

### Thanks!

Kent was right, this was fun. Cheers!
